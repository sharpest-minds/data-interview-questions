Each company's interview process is different. But a common progression you'll see looks something like this
1. introductory interview
2. skill test
3. technical interview

Many companies do more interview rounds than this; Google does 4 or 5.


## Introductory interviews
You'll often be asked questions that relate to your motivations and perhaps also the logic you'd use to solve a problem. For example:

- If you’re currently employed, why you don’t you like your current job? If you’re not, what are some of the ideal aspects you’re looking for in a data science or data analyst job? What specifically excites you and why do you want to do it?
- Out of all of your data analyst projects what was the one you're most proud of and why?
- Have you ever found an analysis that was the opposite of what you were hoping for? If not, suppose you performed an analysis where a client was hoping for one outcome, but in fact you got the opposite of what they were hoping it would show? How did you or would you handle this?

## Skill test

A lot of companies ask you to do a take-home or timed test before you can move forward to the next interviews stage. Here are some great resources to practice for these kinds of tests:

- If it's a classical machine learning or data science role (no deep learning), it will help a lot to go through the first 4 chapters of Ian Goodfellow's book [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org).
- If it's an AI / deep learning role, go through the next 6 chapters of [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org).
- HackerRank problems in [algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) and [data structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures) are also really good. Many companies don't understand how to interview data scientists properly, so they revert to testing for software engineering skills because they do understand how to do that. You might think this doesn't make much sense, and you'd be right about that. But it's the way it is sometimes.
- In the same way, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) has a bunch of great algorithm problems plus [mock interview questions sets](https://leetcode.com/interview/) if you create an account. You can usually find answers to common LeetCode questions by Googling them, so you may not have to pay for a subscription to get what you need from it.


## Technical interview

You'll often be asked the same kinds of questions (from LeetCode and HackerRank) as you'd be asked in a skill test. The difference is you'll have to do them verbally or on a whiteboard, and generally the questions are easier and there's a higher tolerance for mistakes if you're solving them in person. Make sure to explain your thought process throughout - you won't get credit for thinking in silence.

Here are places to find the kinds of questions you might get asked at this stage:

## Smaller companies

In smaller companies (less than 500 employees, generally), you'll often get asked questions that revolve around the metrics that the organization cares most about. For example, if you were applying to Glassdoor, they might care about signups (how many people create accounts instead of just browsing the site casually), number of job applications, monthly activity, and number of reviews submitted on the site.

Smaller companies will often give you some context before the interview. For example, you might be told an interview will be about A/B testing. If that happens, do your homework beforehand and try to brainstorm questions they might ask you about the topic. If you expect an interview about A/B testing, you might get asked questions like:

- How many users should we look at before we can confirm that Feature X works better?
- How can we tell if a feature change will have downstream effects that we don't anticipate?
- How could you resolve the effects of two different A/B tests happening at the same time?

If you're told that an interview is going to focus on business acumen and product intuition, you might get questions like:

- You work for a company that builds product X for user base Y. How would you know if the product was working well? What data would you want to collect? What kind of dashboard would you want to have built?
- What would be some easy mistakes to make? i.e., what numbers could a company decide to measure that would give a misleading sense of how their product is performing?
- What kinds of modeling tools would be helpful here? What sorts of predictions would be valuable?
- How would you measure the performance of those predictive models? Accuracy? F1 score? Precision? Recall? AUC? Which is most relevant to the user experience? Which is most relevant to the company's bottom line?
- What problems could arise if the metric for user experience differs from the metric for the company's bottom line? i.e., in what ways are the company's incentives misaligned from the user's?
