## All Questions
- If you’re currently employed, why you don’t you like your current job? If you’re not, what are some of the ideal aspects you’re looking for in a data science or data analyst job? What specifically excites you and why do you want to do it?
- Out of all of your data analyst projects what was the one you're most proud of and why?
- Have you ever found an analysis that was the opposite of what you were hoping for? If not, suppose you performed an analysis where a client was hoping for one outcome, but in fact you got the opposite of what they were hoping it would show? How did you or would you handle this?
- You're a consultant. Briefly and concisely describe your approach/process to how you would go about solving this problem: You're given a large corpus of Twitter data. Please predict whether the tweet is a disaster or not.
- Explain structured vs unstructured vs semi-structured data.
- What are the advantages of RELU?
- Explain Loss function vs Cost function vs Objective function.
- What is the purpose of the activation function? What happens if I don't use one?
- What are hyper-parameters? Can you list some?
- L1 vs L2 regularization?
- Normalizing vs standardizing inputs? Why do we even do this?
- Your model is producing weird results. What is your process of debugging the model?
- What id the difference bwteen Mini batch gradient descent vs stochastic gradient descent?
- Briefly describe gradient descent with momentum, RMSprop,and Adam.
- What are the benefits of Batch Normalization?
- You're the new and ONLY DS hire for a company that analyzes medical images. The company has 10 million samples. Of the 10 million samples: 3 million are bone fractures for the foot, 2 million are bone fractures for the knee, and 5 million are bone fractures for the shoulder. The company wants to predict the severity of bone fractures in the foot. How would you split your dataset for train, validation, and testing (what % of each)?

## More resources

- If it's a classical machine learning or data science role (no deep learning), it will help a lot to go through the first 4 chapters of Ian Goodfellow's book [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org).
- If it's an AI / deep learning role, go through the next 6 chapters of [_Deep Learning_](http://www.deeplearningbook.org).
- HackerRank problems in [algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) and [data structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures) are also really good. Many companies don't understand how to interview data scientists properly, so they revert to testing for software engineering skills because they do understand how to do that. You might think this doesn't make much sense, and you'd be right about that. But it's the way it is sometimes.
- In the same way, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) has a bunch of great algorithm problems plus [mock interview questions sets](https://leetcode.com/interview/) if you create an account. You can usually find answers to common LeetCode questions by Googling them, so you may not have to pay for a subscription to get what you need from it.
